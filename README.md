Allows the creation of various charts easily. The goal is to be able to easily modify any of the settings. For example, for the bar chart, the x-axis, y-axis, legend, etc... are created as objects within a bar object that you can later modify and then call it to draw.

Charts currently available are:

* Bar Charts (grouped or single)

Later versions will include:

* Pie/Donut Charts
* Area Charts
* Line Charts
* Other fun items
